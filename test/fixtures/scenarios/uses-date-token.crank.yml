description: Proves that date tokens are evaluated at step run-time in ways
  that are well understood.

steps:
# Prove various expected date token formats resolve correctly.
- step: The text 1 hour ago is {{date(1 hour ago)}} should equal Zounds!
- step: The text 1 hour from now is {{date(1 hour from now)}} should equal Zounds!
- step: The text 1 day ago is {{date(1 day ago)}} should equal Zounds!
- step: The text 1 day from now is {{date(1 day from now)}} should equal Zounds!
- step: The text today is {{date(today)}} should equal Zounds!

# Prove multiple tokens can be used in step text or in data.
- step: The text m-y is {{date(midnight yesterday utc)}} and m-2 is {{date(midnight 2 days ago utc)}} should equal Zounds!
